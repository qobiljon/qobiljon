Hi, I am Dr. Kobiljon Toshnazarov.

I am a professional backend developer at [Toptal](https://toptal.com/resume/kobiljon-toshnazarov), and I am also a researcher at Intelligent Mobile Computing Lab ([IMC](http://imc.hanyang.ac.kr/composition/)). Currently I am a PhD candidate in Energy Engineering in Korea Institute of Energy Technology ([KENTECH](https://kentech.ac.kr/)), and my research specialty is stress detection and mHealth data collection ([Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CQp5uugAAAAJ&hl=en)).

With regards to communication, I can communicate in English on an academic level, and I can freely talk in Korean, Russian, and Uzbek languages as well.
My hobbies are going for cycling, running ([Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/qobiljon)), also problem solving sometimes (see my [Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/qobiljonn/)).

I am also interested in freelancing. So if you have an interesting software development project, please kindly email me at [qobiljon@kentech.ac.kr](mailto:qobiljon@kentech.ac.kr), let's talk!
