Hi,

I am Kobiljon, a backend developer at [Toptal](https://toptal.com/resume/kobiljon-toshnazarov), also a researcher at [IMC lab](http://imc.hanyang.ac.kr/composition/).
Currently, I am finalizing my PhD in [KENTECH](https://kentech.ac.kr/), and my research topics are stress detection and mHealth data collection (see [Google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CQp5uugAAAAJ&hl=en)).

With regards to languages, I can communicate in English on an academic level, and I can freely talk in Korean, Russian, and Uzbek languages as well.
And my hobbies are long-distance running and cycling (see [Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/qobiljon)). I also do problem solving from time to time (see [Leetcode profile](https://leetcode.com/qobiljonn/)).

Freelancing? Yes!
If you have an interesting software development project and I somehow got your attention, please kindly email me at [qobiljon@kentech.ac.kr](mailto:qobiljon@kentech.ac.kr).

Nice to meet you, and let's talk!
